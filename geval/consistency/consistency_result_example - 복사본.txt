It expands upon the original query by providing detailed instructions for original prompt's topic, including measurements, tips.
The additional details are all directly related to the topic of original prompt and do not introduce any new or unrelated information.

Consistency: 1
Reason: The result prompt is entirely inconsistent with the original prompt. It does not contain any information related to topic of origin prompt or include requirement as requested in the origin prompt.
