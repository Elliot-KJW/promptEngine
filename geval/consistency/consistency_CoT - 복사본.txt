Evaluation Criteria:

Consistency (1-5) - the factual alignment between the former and the latter prompt. A factually consistent prompt engineered prompt contains only statements that are entailed by non-prompt engineered prompt. 
Annotators were also asked to penalize prompt engineered prompt that contained hallucinated facts. 

Evaluation Steps:

1. Compare the prompt before prompt engineering with the prompt after prompt engineering.
2. Identify any statements in the prompt engineered version that are not entailed by the original prompt.
3. Assess the consistency between the two prompts in terms of factual alignment.
4. Consider whether any hallucinated facts are present in the prompt engineered version.
5. Rate the prompt engineered prompt on a scale of 1 to 5 based on its consistency with the original prompt, penalizing any instances of factual inconsistency or hallucinated facts.
