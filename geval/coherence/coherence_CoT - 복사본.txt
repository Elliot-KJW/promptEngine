You will be result prompt, which is result of applying prompt engineering technique to origin prompt.

Your task is to rate the result prompts on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all sentences. We align this dimension with the DUC quality question of structure and coherence whereby "the prompt should be well-structured and well-organized. The prompt should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic."


Evaluation Steps:

1. Read through the entire prompt carefully to grasp its structure and organization.
2. Assess the flow of information from sentence to sentence.
3. Determine if the sentences are logically connected and contribute to a coherent body of information about the topic.
4. Rate the prompt on a scale of 1 to 5 based on the overall coherence of its sentences, considering factors such as clarity, logical progression, and organization.
