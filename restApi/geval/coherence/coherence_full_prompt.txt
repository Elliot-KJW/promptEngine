Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all sentences. We align this dimension with the DUC quality question of structure and coherence whereby "the prompt should be well-structured and well-organized. The prompt should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic."


Evaluation Steps:

1. Read through the entire prompt carefully to grasp its structure and organization.
2. Assess the flow of information from sentence to sentence.
3. Determine if the sentences are logically connected and contribute to a coherent body of information about the topic.
4. Rate the prompt on a scale of 1 to 5 based on the overall coherence of its sentences, considering factors such as clarity, logical progression, and organization.

Coherence: 1
   - The prompt is poorly structured and disorganized. Sentences lack logical connections and fail to build a coherent body of information. The content is jumbled, making it difficult to understand the main topic.
   - Example: "Cleaners can be made at home. Ingredients like vinegar and lemon. Clean surfaces. Essential oils smell nice. Disinfect with baking soda."

Coherence: 2
   - The prompt has some structure, but still contains several sentences that are poorly connected. The flow of information is weak, leading to partial disorganization. The main topic is somewhat clear, but understanding is hindered.
   - Example: "Homemade cleaners use natural ingredients. Vinegar and lemon juice can clean. Use essential oils for scent. Disinfecting requires other methods. Baking soda is another option."

Coherence: 3
   - The prompt is moderately well-structured with an understandable flow. Some sentences may be loosely connected, and while the main topic is clear, the logical progression may have minor gaps. Overall, the information is fairly organized.
   - Example: "To make a homemade cleaner, you need ingredients like vinegar and lemon juice. These can clean surfaces effectively. For a pleasant scent, add essential oils. Baking soda can be used for disinfecting."

Coherence: 4
   - The prompt is well-structured and mostly well-organized. The sentences are logically connected with a clear flow of information. There may be very minor issues, but overall, it presents a coherent body of information.
   - Example: "Making a homemade cleaner involves using ingredients like vinegar, lemon juice, and baking soda. Vinegar and lemon juice are effective for cleaning surfaces, while baking soda can be used for disinfecting. Adding essential oils can provide a pleasant scent."

Coherence: 5
   - The prompt is exceptionally well-structured and organized. Every sentence logically follows the previous one, building a clear, coherent body of information. The flow is smooth and easy to follow, with no disjointed or unrelated statements.
   - Example: "To create an effective homemade cleaner, start with basic ingredients such as vinegar, lemon juice, and baking soda. Vinegar and lemon juice work well for cleaning various surfaces, removing grime and stains. Baking soda adds a disinfecting property, ensuring surfaces are sanitary. For a fresh scent, incorporate a few drops of essential oils, which also provide additional cleaning benefits."
